# Code book tidy data "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset"

Data input is the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" as provided. 

The data set contains 68 variables, of which the first two indicate the activity and the subject performing the activity.
The remaining 66 variables report the averages belonging to this combination per mean/standard deviation of the measure.

#Subject and Activity

These variables identify the unique subject/activity pair the variables relate to:

subject: the integer subject ID.
activity: the string activity name:
* Walking
* Walking Upstairs
* Walking Downstairs
* Sitting
* Standing
* Laying

# Measurement variables
All variables are means of the corresponding subject-activity combination. All values are floating point numbers.
